Task: Search an array for a particular value
Data in:
- List of values in an array.
- The number of element in the array.
- The value searched for in the array.
Data returned:
- Position in the array of the value.
- If value is NOT found, return -1

------ Linear Search ------
- Advantages:
+ Simplicity
+ The array does NOT have to be in any orders.

- Disadvantage: Time-consuming for large array
WHY? If the desired data is not in the array, the search has to check every element before it returns '-1'
